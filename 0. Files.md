## 0 Files
The following are the naming conventions and guidance for naming C# files.

### 0.1 Partial Class Files
Partial class files are files that contain nested classes for a root file. For instance:

- StudentService.cs
    - StudentService.Validations.cs
    - StudentService.Exceptions.cs

Both validations and exceptions are partial classes to display a different aspect of any given class in a multi-dimensional space.

##### Do
```csharp
StudentService.Validations.cs
```

##### Also, Do
```csharp
StudentService.Validations.Add.cs
```
