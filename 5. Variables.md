## 0. Variables

### 0.0 Naming
Variable names should be concise and representative of nature and the quantity of the value it holds or will potentially hold.

#### 0.0.0 Names
##### Do
```cs
var student = new Student();
```
##### Don't
```cs
var s = new Student();
```
##### Also, Don't
```cs
var stdnt = new Student();
```

The same rule applies to lambda expressions:
##### Do
```cs
students.Where(student => student ... );
```
##### Don't
```cs
students.Where(s => s ... );
```
<br />

#### 0.0.1 Plurals 
##### Do
```cs
var students = new List<Student>();
```
##### Don't
```cs
var studentList = new List<Student>();
```
<br />

#### 0.0.2 Names with Types

##### Do
```cs
var student = new Student();
```
##### Don't
```cs
var studentModel = new Student();
```
##### Also, Don't
```cs
var studentObj = new Student();
```
<br />

#### 0.0.3 Nulls or Defaults
If a variable value is it's default such as ```0``` for ```int``` or ```null``` for strings and you are not planning on changing that value (for testing purposes for instance) then the name should identify that value. 
##### Do
```cs
Student noStudent = null;
```
##### Don't
```cs
Student student = null;
```
##### Also, Do
```cs
int noChangeCount = 0;
```

##### But, Don,t
```cs
int changeCount = 0;
```
<br /> <br />

### 0.1 Declarations
Declaring a variable and instantiating it should indicate the immediate type of the variable, even if the value is to be determined later.
#### 0.1.0 Clear Types
If the right side type is clear, then use ```var``` to declare your variable
##### Do
```cs
var student = new Student();
```
##### Don't
```cs
Student student = new Student();
````
<br />

Assign properties directly if you are declaring a type with one property. 

#### Do 

```cs
var inputStudentEvent = new StudentEvent();
inputStudentEvent.Student = inputProcessedStudent;
```

#### Don't

```cs
var inputStudentEvent = new StudentEvent
{
    Student = inputProcessedStudent
};
```



#### 0.1.1 Semi-Clear Types
If the right side isn't clear (but known) of the returned value type, then you must explicitly declare your variable with it's type.
##### Do
```cs
Student student = GetStudent();
```
##### Don't
```cs
var student = GetStudent();
```
<br />

#### 0.1.2 Unclear Types 
If the right side isn't clear and unknown (such as an anonymous types) of the returned value type, you may use ```var``` as your variable type.
##### Do
```cs
var student = new
{
    Name = "Hassan",
    Score = 100
};
```
<br /> <br />

### 0.2 Organization

#### 0.2.0 Breakdown
If a variable declaration exceeds 120 characters, break it down starting from the equal sign.

##### Do
```cs
List<Student> washingtonSchoolsStudentsWithGrades = 
    await GetAllWashingtonSchoolsStudentsWithTheirGradesAsync();

```
##### Don't 
```cs
List<Student> washgintonSchoolsStudentsWithGrades = await GetAllWashingtonSchoolsStudentsWithTheirGradesAsync();
```
<br />

#### 0.2.1 Multiple Declarations
Declarations that occupy two lines or more should have a new line before and after them to separate them from previous and next variables declarations.

##### Do
```cs
Student student = GetStudent();

List<Student> washingtonSchoolsStudentsWithGrades = 
    await GetAllWashingtonSchoolsStudentsWithTheirGradesAsync();

School school = await GetSchoolAsync();
```

##### Don't
```cs
Student student = GetStudent();
List<Student> washgintonSchoolsStudentsWithGrades = 
    await GetAllWashingtonSchoolsStudentsWithTheirGradesAsync();
School school = await GetSchoolAsync();
```
Also, declarations of variables that are of only one line should have no new lines between them.

##### Do
```cs
Student student = GetStudent();
School school = await GetSchoolAsync();
```

##### Don't
```cs
Student student = GetStudent();

School school = await GetSchoolAsync();

```
